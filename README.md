MY first project


How it works:
When X wins, it plays the embedded "Thank you" sound for X.

When O wins, it plays the embedded "Thank you" sound for O.

Sounds are base64-encoded .wav inside the script â€” no extra files needed.

The click sound plays every move as before.

Note:
The current base64 voice sounds are placeholders (short beeps). If you want real voice saying "Thank you X" and "Thank you O", I can help you generate those and embed them similarly â€” just ask!

Feel free to copy-paste this and test it out. Iâ€™m here if you want me to improve the voice sounds or add anything else!
