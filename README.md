MY first project.



How it works: When X wins, it plays the embedded "Thank you" sound for X.

When O wins, it plays the embedded "Thank you" sound for O.

Sounds are base64-encoded .wav inside the script — no extra files needed.

Features:

Two-player gameplay (X and O) with turn-based moves

Visual background color change on player moves

Win and draw detection with a friendly message display

Sound effects for clicks and voice feedback saying "Thank you" when X or O wins — no external sound files needed (all sounds embedded!)

Reset and New Game buttons for quick restarts

Clean, responsive UI suitable for desktop and mobile browsers

How to Use Click on any empty box to place your mark (X or O)

The game automatically checks for a winner or draw after each move

When a player wins, a congratulatory message and voice feedback plays

Use the "Reset Game" or "New Game" buttons to start over
